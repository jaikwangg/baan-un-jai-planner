# PyInstaller
#  Usually these files are written by a parent script to a temporary directory,
#  in which case you can use gitignore to ignore the entire directory.
#  Other times these files are written to the project root directory.
#  In this case, you'll want to ignore them directly.
#  NOTE: PyInstaller writes its files into the same folder that your executable
#  is generated in.  If you want your executable to be part of your repository,
#  you may need to edit this file to ignore these files explicitly.
